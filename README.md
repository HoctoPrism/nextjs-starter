# Starter NextJS

This starter is a project for my own use, there's no other ambition for now. It's using a typescript, a preconfigure MUI theme (dark and light). React hook form. An eslint config
There's a component Type that will be available as an example for a CRUD.

You will be able to find
- emotion/cache
- mui/material
- immutability-helper
- react-hook-form
- sass
- axios:

It's possible to change the theme in `src/utils/theme`, there's two files for the theme (darkTheme and lightTheme)
